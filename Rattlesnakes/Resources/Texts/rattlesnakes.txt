Dorn came in June the rattlesnakes in July
the river is low the forest dry
every morning I get up early
walking to Naked Falls to swim
the words come slowly
the work comes slowly off alone in the workmans' bunkhouse
behind my mother's place home but doubly not home
I am here to write to write about writing
***
The words come slowly, the work comes slowly
Off alone in the workmans' bunkhouse
behind my mother's place at the other end
of the long long field fronting the house
of the lord of the manor home but doubly not home
Every morning's swim is double visioned
the cold of the water and the heat of rocks
and the deep blue green dark green gradient
of sky to river and the stillness surrounding the rumbling rush and the smell of pine needles
***
baking in the sun and the flies
skimming the water's top and trout breaching to feast on them
cliches are only cliches if you haven't lived them
all bouncing back echoes of summers passing.
I am home but not home two years with only enough pounds for pints and fags and stuck in a studio 
every morning out here knocks a little more of the encrustations off me two years
elsewhere
***
they come and they came and they kept coming
silent slither first we'd know 
dogs bar bar barking
then the rattle a tiny engine dry starting first
just a few tchookatchookatchooka one two three and then
ztztztztztzt it's wound-up up to speed zinging along like an un-lubricated two-stroke
about to throw a piston
***
we freeze
mom yells for us kids freeze dad grabs the big
long contractor's blunt nose shovel and begins the dance
dogs bar bar barking dashing back-and-forth
ztztztztztztztztztztztztztzt it's scared the dogs freaking it out
we're scared a six-year old won't last long
with a rattler bite too little body mass to keep the poison from the heart in the forty-minute drive to town 
we're scared
***
snake strikes
once 'ping' twice 'ping' at the shovel dad keeps
his distance let's it decide it can't do anything about the shovel
and start worrying about the dogs again 
ztztztztztztztztztztztz
the shovel whistles over and down, trapping the body 
just behind the neck unbelievably the rattle goes faster hyperspeed,
the rattler trapped under the edge of the shovel 
the rattle goes faster still zzzzztzzzzzzzztzzzzzzztzzzzztzzzzzzzztzzzzzzzt
***
then stops as my father steps on the shovel's shoulder drives
the sharpened edge down through snakes body 
now two snakes
the long one flopping about the other's mouth spasming we can
see the fangs swing out and back in again once twice three times then
both are still as are the dogs
as are we
